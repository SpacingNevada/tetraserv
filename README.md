# TetraServ

This is *intended* to become a toolset for managing a BYOND server; on a
much smaller scale than tgstation-server, as well as being being
intended for native linux use.

It is also *intended* to provide a set of python libraries for
interfacing your own code -- discord/irc/etc bots, and whathaveyou --
with BYOND servers, either hosted or standalone.

(Whether we get to that point remains to be seen. :shrug: )

## Libraries

* [`byond/topic`](doc/Topic.md) - A 'low-level' interface for sending
  BYOND Topic() packets, in the same vein as
  [BYOND.TopicSender](https://github.com/Cyberboss/BYOND.TopicSender)
